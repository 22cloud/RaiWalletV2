        Welcome to NanoWallet.io!
      </h1>
      <p style="text-align:left">
        Thanks for registering with us. We hope you like our service and you find it useful to manage your
        NANO safely, from any device, and without the need of downloading the ledger :) <br/><br/>
        
        To login, you are going to need your wallet identifier, this is: <br/>
        <code>{{ $identifier }}</code>
        <br/><br/>
        The password is the one you used to register. We don&apos;t have access to it and it is the only way to decrypt your wallet 
        so make sure you do not lose it. If you do, we cannot help. <br/>
        In case you forget or lose your wallet identifier you can recover it with your email.
        You can also change that identifier with an alias (much more easier to remember).
        <br/><br/>
        So yeah! If you need anything you can contact us at support@nanowallet.io.<br/><br/>
        Sincerely,<br/>
        NanoWallet.io Team.
